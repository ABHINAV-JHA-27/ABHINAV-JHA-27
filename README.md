# Hi there, I'm Abhinav 👋

🚀 A Software Developer who loves experimenting and learning new things

💻 Currently I am Gsoc Contributer at SugarLabs, and I am working on Music Blocks v4 will revolutionize the way children and beginners learn programming.

📚 During my internship at Quickiii, a tech startup, I honed my skills by working on the development and maintenance of the Buyer and Seller Apps. My primary focus was on Cross-Platform Mobile Development, utilizing React Native to maintain the Android and iOS apps for both Buyers and Sellers.

🚀 In terms of open-source contribution, I've been contributing to SugarLabs Recently and plan to continue doing so.

🏔 In my free time, I like to read books, watch documentaries and Anime.
